# Streamlit PLSR Model App

This repository contains a Streamlit app that uses a Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) model for predictions based on user inputs.

## Features

- User can input values for various features.
- The app predicts target values using the PLSR model.
- Model performance is displayed with RÂ² and RMSE metrics.
- Scatter plots show predicted vs measured values for each target variable.

## How to Use

1. Go to the [PLSR app](https://arkashine01-aeyrbogn59vkpwoet3rxqd.streamlit.app/).
2. Enter values for the features in the input fields.
3. Click the "Predict" button to get the predicted values.
4. View the model performance metrics and scatter plots.
